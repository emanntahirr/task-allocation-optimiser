# Task Allocation Optimiser 

**Description**
Task Allocation Optimizer is a Java-based program that assigns tasks to workers based on their available time. The goal is to distibute tasks efficiently, minimizing idle time and ensuring that the workers dont exceed their maximum working hours. The project is designed to improve over time, with additional features and optimisation planned.

**Technologies Used**
- Java

**How it Works**
- Tasks are created with specified durations.
- Workers are assigned tasks based on their available time.
- The current version allocates tasks to workers in a simple manner, starting with a basic greedy approach (tasks are assigned to the worker with the least total assigned time).

**Project Milestones**
- **Version 1**: Initial working version of the task allocation system.
- Future Improvements will focus on increasing efficiency, balancing workloads better, and potentially creating a web and mobile app interface.

**Running the Project**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emanntahirr/task-allocation-optimiser.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd task-allocation-optimiser
3. Compile and run the project using Java:
   ```bash
   java Main.java
   java Main
**Future Improvements**
- Optimise the algorithm to handle larger sets of tasks and workers more efficiently.
- Implement a web or mobile interface for easier task management and visualisation.
- Add the option to customise worker availability and task priority.
